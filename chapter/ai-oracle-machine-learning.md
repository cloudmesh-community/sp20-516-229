# Oracle Cloud Built-in Machine Learning

* Benjamin Tracy sp20-516-226

## Introduction

Oracle has begun integrating built-in machine learning features into its many different Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings.
Since there are many different service clouds offered by Oracle, both the methods they use and the results they hope to 
produce vary greatly.


## How Oracle's Clouds Leverage Machine Learning

### Managing Data

Oracle touts its new Autonomous Databases as the first of their kind, claiming that they are self-securing, self-repairing, 
and self-driving [@oracle-MLDatabase-sp20-516-226].

### Data Analysis

In order to help customers quickly gain insights into data that has been gathered, Oracle has developed a plethora of options
that will allow a customer to quickly analyse data in order to aid in making business decisions [@oracle-MLAnalytics-sp20-516-226].
This includes implementations that handle natural language processing and generation in an attempt to effectively communicate analysis 
to the user, and of course it also includes the models from which this analysis is derived [@oracle-MLAnalytics-sp20-516-226]. 

### Infrastructure Management

With the goal of ensuring that infrastructure hosted by Oracle remains as performant, reliable, and secure as possible, Oracle 
uses machine learning to determine what could be at the root cause of a problem affecting the system [@oracle-ML-sp20-516-226].
