### Renewal Energy : Thermal 

Thermal energy is a kind of energy that is related to the temperature of matters and also called heat energy. The energy which comes from heated matters is called thermal energy.

Data centers are producing a lot of heat from IT equipment and the cooling system is the second-largest consumer in a data center after the Information Technology (IT) equipments.Geothermal energy can be used for heating and cooling purposes for data centers.

Below are some of examples  
1-American College Testing(Iowa)    
2-Prairie Bunkers, LLC(Nebraska)  
3-Verne Global(Iceland)    


# E.Datacenter.5:


Below are examples of companies that renew waste heat.

IBM: The hot air generated by the Uitikon center will flow through heat exchangers to warm water that will be pumped into the nearby pool. The town covered the cost of some of the connecting equipment but will get to use the heat for free.

Oracle: The innovations center on the use of waste heat from the IT equipment for space humidification in the winter; evaporative cooling in summer; reduced primary airflow to the IT equipment; strategic hot air separation with recirculation; and novel controls that enabled the data center to achieve very high cooling efficiency at a lower initial investment cost.

# E.Datacenter.8:

The biggest risk of the data center is power outages. According to the Ponemon Institute LLC study(2016), the average cost of a data center outage has steadily increased from $505,502 in 2010 to $740,357.
